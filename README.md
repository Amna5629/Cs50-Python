# Cs50-Python
My solutions to Harvard’s CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python) – including problem sets and the final project Birthstone Explorer.

Topics Covered
Functions and Variables
Understanding how to define and use functions in Python.

Variables and their scope in different contexts.

Conditionals
Using if, else, and elif to make decisions in the code.

Logical operators (and, or, not) to combine conditions.

Loops
Implementing for and while loops to iterate over sequences.

Using break, continue, and else with loops for control flow.

Exceptions
Handling errors with try, except, else, and finally blocks.

Raising exceptions when necessary to handle edge cases.

Libraries
Importing and using Python libraries and modules.

Using third-party libraries such as requests and beautifulsoup4.

Unit Tests
Writing unit tests with Python’s built-in unittest framework.

Ensuring code quality by testing individual functions and methods.

File I/O
Reading from and writing to files in Python.

Handling different file formats like .txt and .csv.

Regular Expressions
Using the re library to perform pattern matching and text manipulation.

Finding and replacing patterns in strings.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Creating classes and objects in Python.

Implementing inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Et Cetera
Additional Python concepts such as list comprehensions, decorators, and lambda functions.

Final Project
Description: For the final project, I developed [insert your final project name here]. This project combines multiple aspects of Python programming learned throughout the course, such as file handling, web scraping, and implementing algorithms.

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, SQLite
